A basic device driver written as part of my final project in CS 533: Advanced Operating Systems. 

The driver can read and write to a "device," which is implemented as a basic test file. A typical device might interpret such actions as more generic instructions, such as opening a disk drive, or operating a piece of machinery. 

The Linux driver Bible can be found with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Device-Drivers-Jonathan-Corbet/dp/0596005903/">Linux Device Drivers, by Corbet et al</a>.
